# EmergencyInsights-Analyzing-911-Call-Patterns
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of 911 call data to uncover patterns and insights that can improve emergency response strategies. The dataset contains over 99,000 entries of 911 calls, including details such as location, time, reason for the call, and more.
üìä Key Features: Data Exploration: Analyze the dataset to identify the most common reasons for calls, geographic distribution of incidents, and temporal trends. Data Visualization: Utilize libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative visualizations that illustrate call patterns by reason, day of the week, and month. Time Series Analysis: Convert timestamps into DateTime objects and extract relevant features such as hour, month, and day of the week to analyze trends over time.
üîç Insights Gained: The most frequent reason for calls was related to EMS (Emergency Medical Services), emphasizing the need for medical assistance. Geographic analysis revealed the top zip codes with the highest call volumes. Temporal analysis indicated peak times for emergency calls, aiding in resource allocation for emergency services. üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used: Python: For data manipulation and analysis. Pandas: For data handling and preprocessing. NumPy: For numerical operations. Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
